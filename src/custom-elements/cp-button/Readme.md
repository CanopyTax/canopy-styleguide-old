# cp-button
Provides styling for `<button>` elements.

## HTML Usage
```html
<cp-button type="primary">
	<button>
		Click me
	</button>
</cp-button>
```

## JS Events
Right now there are no events that cp-button emits. Use event listeners on the `<button>` element
itself to get key events, click events, etc.
