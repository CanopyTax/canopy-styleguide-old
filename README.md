# Canopy Styleguide
The Canopy Styleguide is a css and javascript library that provides leaf-node ui components for web applications. It exposes
global css classes and [custom elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Custom_Elements).

## Usage
The styleguide is imported as a [sofe service](https://github.com/CanopyTax/sofe).

```
SystemJS.import('canopy-styleguide!sofe');
```

## Documentation
Global css classes are documented in a web application that can be viewed by running `npm run website`. The custom elements
are documented in the [custom-elements](/src/custom-elements) directory.
